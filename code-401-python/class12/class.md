**Stack:**
*In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top*

**Queue:**

An excellent example of a queue is a line of students in the food court of the UC. New additions to a line made to the back of the queue.Enqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item.

### FIFO & LILO and LIFO & FILO

**Queue**: First In First Out (FIFO): The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue, used by a queue.

**Stack**: Last In First Out (LIFO): The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack, used by a stack

**OR**

**Stack**: First In Last Out (FILO): The first object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.

**Queue**: Last In Last Out (LILO): The last object or item in a queue is the last object or item to leave the queue.
