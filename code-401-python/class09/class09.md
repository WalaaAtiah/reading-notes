 ## A data structure: [source](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-structure#:~:text=A%20data%20structure%20is%20a,they%20need%20in%20appropriate%20ways.)

    * is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data
    * Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways
    * data structures frame the organization of information so that machines and humans can better understand it.
    * Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. 
  
### How are data structures used?
    Data structures are used to implement the physical forms of abstract data types.Data structures are a crucial part of designing efficient software. They also play a critical role in algorithm design and how those algorithms are used within computer programs.

     1. Storing data
     2. Managing resources and services.
     3. Data exchange.
     4. Ordering and sorting
     5. Indexing
     6. Searching
     7. Scalability
   
   ### Characteristics of data structures
     1. Linear or non-linear:data items are arranged in sequential order, such as with an array, or in an unordered sequence, such as with a graph.
     2. Homogeneous or heterogeneous
     3. Static or dynamic

### How to choose a data structure
1. Supported operations
2. Computational complexity
3. Programming elegance

## Data Structure and Algorithms - Linked List :[source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/linked_list_algorithms.htm)

*Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link.*

* Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

* Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

* LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

### Types of Linked List

1. **Simple Linked List** − Item navigation is forward only.

2. **Doubly Linked List** − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

3. **Circular Linked List** − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.


### Basic Operations

1. **Insertion** − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

2. **Deletion** − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

3. **Display** − Displays the complete list.

4. **Search** − Searches an element using the given key.

5. **Delete** − Deletes an element using the given key.
