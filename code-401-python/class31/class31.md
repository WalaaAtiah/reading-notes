## Component-Based Architecture:[source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

**The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability**

**Component-oriented software design has many advantages over the traditional object-oriented approaches such as**

1. Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.

2. Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.


### What is a Component?

**A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.**


### Views of a Component
A component can have three different views 

1. **object-oriented view**:  component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes. Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design)


2.  **conventional view**:It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic, the internal data structures


3.  **process-related view**: In this view, instead of creating each component from scratch, the system is building from existing components maintained in a library

### Characteristics of Components

1. **Reusability**
2. **Replaceable**
3. **Not context specific**
4. **Extensible**
5. **Encapsulated**
6. **Independent**
