## What is Serverless?[source](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)

**Serverless is a cloud application development and execution model that lets developers build and run code without managing servers, and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure.**

### Serverless does not mean 'no servers'
*The name notwithstanding, there are most definitely servers in serverless computing. 'Serverless' describes the developer’s experience with those servers—they are are invisible to the developer, who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.*
