# Read 35 : Authentication

## Authentication [source](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/authentication)

### **What is authentication**?

Authentication technology provides access control for systems by checking to see if a user's credentials match the credentials in a database of authorized users or in a data authentication server. In doing this, authentication assures secure systems, secure processes and enterprise information security.

### **Why is authentication important in cybersecurity**?

Authentication enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users or processes to gain access to their protected resources

### **How does authentication work**?

During authentication, credentials provided by the user are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information either on the local operating system server or through an authentication server. If the credentials entered match those on file and the authenticated entity is authorized to use the resource, the user is granted access

### **What is authentication used for?**
User and process authentication are used to ensure that only authorized individuals or processes are allowed to access company IT resources. Depending on the use cases for which authentication is used, authentication can consist of either SFA, 2FA or MFA.


### Currently used authentication factors include the following:

* **Knowledge factor**. The knowledge factor, or something you know, may be any authentication credentials that consist of information that the user possesses, including a personal identification number (PIN), a username, a password or the answer to a secret question.
  
* **Possession factor**. The possession factor, or something you have, may be any credential based on items that the user can own and carry with them, including hardware devices.
  
* **Inherence factor**. The inherence factor, or something you are, is typically based on some form of biometric identification
  
* **Location factor**. Where you are may be less specific, but the location factor is sometimes used as an adjunct to the other factors.
  
* **Time factor**. Like the location factor, the time factor, or when you are authenticating, is not sufficient on its own, but it can be a supplemental mechanism for weeding out attackers who attempt to access a resource at a time when that resource is not available to the authorized user

### **Authentication vs. authorization**
Authorization includes the process through which an administrator grants rights to authenticated users, as well as the process of checking user account permissions to verify that the user has been granted access to those resources. The privileges and preferences granted for an authorized account depend on the user's permissions, which are either stored locally or on an authentication server. The settings defined for all these environment variables are established by an administrator.
