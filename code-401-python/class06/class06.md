## What are Design Patterns  [source](https://medium.com/@Mahmoud_Zalt/software-design-patterns-simplified-8a72232d52b1)

### A design pattern: 
* **is only a description or template for how to solve a problem!**
  
* **Patterns are formalized best practices that the Software Developer can use to solve common problems when designing an application.**

<br>

### Below is thew difference between, Programming Paradigms, Architectural Patterns, Design Patterns and Design Principles:

* **Programming Paradigms**: A way to classify programming languages based on their coding styles and features.(Procedural, Functional, Object-orientedâ€¦).
* **Architectural Patterns**: Reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture within a given context.

* **Design Patterns**: Reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design within a given context

* **Design Principles**: Represent a set of guidelines that help developers to avoid having a bad design

<br>

### There is 3 major types of design patterns:

 1. **Creational Patterns**:Some Creational Patterns:
    * Factory Method.m 
    * Singleton
    * Abstract Factory

2. **Structural Patterns**:Some Structural Patterns:

   * Facade
   * Adapter
   * Decorator

3. **Behavioral Patterns**:Some Behavioral Patterns:

   * Observer
   * Mediator
   * Chain of Responsibility

## Risk Analysis [source](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

### Why use Risk Analysis?
 **using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas ,it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks.**

### Risk Identification: have different sets of risks

1. **Business Risks**:t is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.
2. **Testing Risks**:
3. **Premature Release Risk**: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is require
4. **Software Risks**: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

### How to perform Risk Analysis?

1. Searching the risk

2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3. Measures for the risk identified

## Dependency Injection (DI) [source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/)


**Is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).**

### Types of dependency injection:
1. constructor injection
2. setter injection
3. interface injection
